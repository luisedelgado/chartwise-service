# üõ°Ô∏è ChartWise Incident Response Plan (IRP)

**Last revised:** May 16, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0.1

---

## Purpose

This document outlines how ChartWise identifies, assesses, and responds to potential or actual security incidents that could involve electronic protected health information (ePHI), in compliance with HIPAA‚Äôs Security Rule (¬ß164.308(a)(6)).

## Scope

This plan applies to all internal and external systems that process, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI), directly or indirectly.

## Business Associate Inventory

### Systems & Vendors That Handle PHI

| System     | Function | BAA Signed |
|------------|----------|------------|
| **AWS** | 1. **FastAPI App (ECS service)**: Receives, processes, encrypts/decrypts PHI. Hosted in a Docker container running on ECS. Neither the decrypted PHI nor the application memory are accessible by ECS.<br><br>Secrets (including encryption keys like `CHARTWISE_PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) are stored using AWS Secrets Manager and injected securely as environment variables. No secrets are committed to the codebase or hard-coded in container images.<br><br>2. **Postgres DB (RDS instance)**: Stores encrypted PHI at rest. | Yes |
| **Pinecone** | Stores embeddings representing PHI, along with encrypted PHI metadata. | Yes |
| **OpenAI** | Summarizes patient sessions and generates insights from PHI. | Yes |
| **Deepgram** | Transcribes audio sessions containing PHI. | Yes |
| **DocuPanda** | Uses OCR to process images containing PHI text. | Yes |

### Supporting Vendors That Do Not Handle PHI

| System     | Function | BAA Signed |
|------------|----------|------------|
| **Resend** | Sends transactional emails. PHI is never included in email bodies. | No |
| **InfluxDB** | Stores app-level metrics (e.g., volume, latency). No PHI captured. | No |

---

## Incident Types

| Incident Type       | Example |
|---------------------|---------|
| Data breach         | Pinecone externally compromised. |
| PHI leakage         | PHI accidentally logged or included in email/web responses. |
| Unauthorized access | Therapist accessing another provider‚Äôs patient records. |
| Denial of service   | Intentional disruption of app/server availability. |
| Key compromise      | Environment key `CHARTWISE_PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is exposed. |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Person | Responsibilities |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Security Lead** | Luis Delgado, ChartWise Cofounder |- Primary responder, coordinates containment, leads postmortems. |
| **Developer(s)** | Luis Delgado (backend), Contractor (frontend) |- Assist in investigation, patching, system validation.<br>Developers do not have direct access to decrypted PHI.<br>- All database access is scoped through RBAC with session-level `app.current_user_id` enforcement. This ensures no user can access another user‚Äôs data, whether intentionally or accidentally. |
| **Infra Providers and Third-Party Vendors** | AWS, Pinecone, OpenAI, Deepgram, DocuPanda, InfluxDB | - Support incident reporting and investigation, and infrastructure forensics.<br>- Provide breach notifications in accordance with BAA terms.<br>Supply audit logs or security incident documentation upon request. |

## Incident Response Lifecycle

### Detection & Identification

- Encryption/decryption failures automatically fail-safe.
- Audit logs monitored for anomalies (e.g. frequent 403s, odd IPs).
- Contractors operate under RBAC permissions.
- CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and ECS container logs monitored via AWS CloudWatch.
- Alerts triggered on anomaly patterns (e.g., credential use from unexpected geolocation, abnormal DB queries).

### Containment

- Revoke tokens, sessions, or keys.
- Temporarily restrict or lock compromised services.
- Isolate attacker or actor through RBAC/user suspension.

### Eradication & Recovery

- Patch vulnerabilities.
- Rotate keys/secrets (`os.environ`) and regenerate if necessary.
- Restore from backups if corruption/loss occurred.

### Notification

**If PHI was compromised**:

- Notify affected users within 60 days.
- Report to HHS if breach affects 500+ individuals or meets other federal criteria.
- Record incident log internally for 6 years per HIPAA.

**Escalation Criteria**

- The Security Lead determines severity and whether breach notification is necessary.
- Legal counsel is consulted before notifying external regulators or affected users.

### Postmortem

Internal writeup due within 7 days, including:

- Timeline
- Root cause
- Detection
- Resolution
- Recommended changes

Update IRP or SOPs accordingly.

## Communication Plan

| Stakeholder         | Communication Method         |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Internal Team       | Email or secure messaging    |
| Affected Users      | Email via Resend             |
| Infrastructure Vendors | Support portals & dashboards |
| Regulators (HHS)    | OCR Breach Portal            |

---

## Review & Testing

- Security Lead ensures annual review of this plan.
- Tabletop simulation tests conducted yearly.
- Latest IRP version stored in Git under `compliance/incident-response-plan.md`.

### Tabletop Exercise ‚Äì Example Run

**Pre-Test Setup**

- Choose scenario: encryption key leak (`CHARTWISE_PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`)
- Assign roles:  
  - Security Lead: Luis Delgado  
  - Backend Engineer: Luis Delgado  
  - Frontend Contractor: Observer  
- Distribute IRP copies
- Notify team it's a simulation

**Simulate the Incident**

- Announce mock incident
- Simulate detection (e.g., GitHub secret scan alert)
- Response steps:
  - Contain: revoke key, block old ciphertext
  - Eradicate: rotate key, re-encrypt
  - Recover: test decryption
  - Notify: simulate Resend + HHS contact

**Debrief & Post-Test**

- Timeline, gaps, integrity check
- Simulated breach report filed
- Adjust IRP/tooling if needed
- Schedule next test in 12 months

## Data Retention & Backup

### Retention Policy

- PHI retained for at least 6 years
- Data deletion requests honored per HIPAA/contractual terms

### Backup Strategy

- **AWS Postgres (PHI storage):**  
  - Daily, encrypted, retained 7+ days
- **App State:**  
  - Ephemeral Docker images (no PHI)
- **Pinecone, Vendors:**  
  - Backups managed by vendors per BAA

### Secrets Management

- Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager with 90-day auto-rotation
- IAM-restricted access, logged via CloudTrail
- Env vars injected at runtime only
- KMS key (`CHARTWISE_PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) used for encryption
  - Auto-rotated every 365 days
  - Strict IAM access controls
  - Decryption works seamlessly post-rotation

### Access & Review

- Only authorized staff can trigger restores
- Backup configuration: reviewed quarterly
- Retention/deletion policies: reviewed annually
